# 🎄My 2022 adventjs commented solutions🎄

adventjs.dev is a platform developed by  where you can practice your JavaScript skills via challenges as an advent calendar. This repository contains my proposed solutions for all the challenges.

As I consider that if you are reading this you may be in the search of some help for succeeding on a challenge, all my solutions are described so you can understand what I implemented. There are some challenges with more than one solution (for example, an iterative and a functional one).

The solutions descriptions contain a title for identifying it, the calculated time complexity, an explanation step by step and, some author comments about it.

If you think you got into a better solution than the one I propose, please let me know, so I can include your solution (all the credits will be yours, of course).
