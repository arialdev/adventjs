# adventjs commented solutions
adventjs.dev is a platform where you can practise your JavaScript abilities via challenges as an advent calendar.
This repository contains my proposed solutions for all the challenges. As I consider that if you are reading this you may be in the search of some help for succeeding on challenge, all my solutions are described so you can understand what I implemented.
If you get into a better solution than the one I propose, please let me know, so I can include your solution (all the credits will be yours, of course).
